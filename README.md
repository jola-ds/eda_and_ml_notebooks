# EDA and ML Notebooks

This repository contains small-scale exploratory data analysis (EDA) and machine learning tasks.  
It serves as a practice space for testing ideas, experimenting with datasets, and building intuition for data workflows.  

## Structure
Each subfolder contains a self-contained notebook and any supporting files:
- `housing_market_analysis/` : Predicting house prices with regression models  

## Tools
- Python  
- Pandas, NumPy  
- Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly
- Scikit-learn  

## Purpose
This repo is intended for learning and experimentation.  
Notebooks may not be production-ready but capture my approach to analysis and model building.
